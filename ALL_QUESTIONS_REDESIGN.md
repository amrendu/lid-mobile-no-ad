## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Core state variables
const [currentQuestionIndex, setCurrentQuestionIndex] = useState(0);
const [answeredQuestions, setAnsweredQuestions] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [showQuestionOverview, setShowQuestionOverview] = useState(false);
```

### Data Persistence
```javascript
// Storage keys
const BOOKMARKS_KEY = 'bookmarked_questions_v2';
const ANSWERED_KEY = 'answered_questions_v2';

// Load and save answered questions
const loadData = async () => {
  const answeredData = await getItem(ANSWERED_KEY, []);
  setAnsweredQuestions(answeredData ?? []);
};
```

### Navigation Functions
```javascript
// Navigation handlers
const goToNextQuestion = () => {
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questionsData.length - 1) {
    setCurrentQuestionIndex(prev => prev + 1);
  }
};

const goToPreviousQuestion = () => {
  if (currentQuestionIndex > 0) {
    setCurrentQuestionIndex(prev => prev - 1);
  }
};

const goToQuestion = (index: number) => {
  setCurrentQuestionIndex(index);
  setShowQuestionOverview(false);
};
```
